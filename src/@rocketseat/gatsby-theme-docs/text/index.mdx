# Introduction

Dark lineage RPG Wiki

The aim of this wiki is to provide players with a comprehensive resource for a game that
was not well documented. The data was extracted from v0.19, but remains valid for v0.20 as well.

You'll find at the bottom of most non data page a link to suggest modifications via Github.
If you have any questions or would like to request a new feature, don't hesitate to send a message
either through Github or else via Battle.net to Werfert#1902.

> As you'll quickly find out, the wiki is far from complete. The first goal was to provide comprehensive loot tables, which were not available online.

## Current task list
